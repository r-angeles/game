## Getting Started

### Make
(Note: Makefile is not supported on Windows)
For setting up virtual environment and dependencies:
```
make init
```

To see list of make commands, invoke:
```
make help
```
### venv
Python's built-in `venv` will be used to create a virtual environment

### Installing dependencies
Important: The virtual environment must be activated if installing dependencies to avoid possible installation conflicts with other Python versions and packages.

Linux/MacOS:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
